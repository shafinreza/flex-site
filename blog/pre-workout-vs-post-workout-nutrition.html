      <p>
        Training performance depends heavily on how you fuel.
        Understanding the difference between pre-workout and post-workout nutrition
        can dramatically improve results.
      </p>

      <h2>Pre-Workout: Sustained Energy</h2>
      <p>
        Before training, your goal is steady energy.
        Healthy fats combined with carbohydrates help prevent crashes.
        A small serving of natural peanut butter with fruit
        provides slow-release energy.
      </p>

      <h2>Post-Workout: Recovery & Repair</h2>
      <p>
        After training, your body needs nutrients for muscle repair.
        Pairing peanut butter with complex carbs and protein
        supports glycogen replenishment and recovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Consistency Wins</h2>
      <p>
        It’s not about extreme diets.
        It’s about consistent, clean ingredients that support your goals.
      </p>
